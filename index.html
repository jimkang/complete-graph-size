        We're going to at interesting things:
        <span class="important-term">complete graphs</span> and
        <span class="important-term">triangular numbers</span>. We are also
        going to look at a relationship that they share.

      <p>
        So, what is a "complete graph"? It's a graph in which every single
        vertex is connected to ever other point in the graph by an edge.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, here is a complete graph for
        <span class="vertex-count-label">3</span> vertices:
      </p>

      <svg
        id="complete-graph-example-board"
        width="500"
        height="500"
        viewBox="0 0 100 100"
      >
        <g id="complete-graph-example-edge-root"></g>
        <g id="complete-graph-example-vertex-root"></g>
      </svg>

      <input
        id="example-graph-vertices-control"
        type="range"
        value="3"
        min="1"
        max="25"
        step="0.1"
      />
      <p class="instruction">
        Move the slider to change the number of vertices (dots) in the graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you increase the number of vertices, the number of edges (the lines)
        increases far faster. We'll look more closely at that relationship
        later.

    <section class="step" id="triangular-number-step">
      <p>Now, let's talk about what a "triangular number" is.</p>
      <p>
        If you have <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span> dots per
        side in an equilateral triangle like the one below, the triangular
        number is <span class="triangular-number-result-label">6</span> &mdash;
        the total number of dots in the triangle.
      </p>
      <svg
        id="triangular-number-board"
        width="600"
        height="500"
        viewBox="0 0 120 100"
      >
        <g id="triangle-row-root"></g>
        <g id="triangle-dot-root"></g>
      </svg>

      <input
        id="triangle-side-length-control"
        type="range"
        value="3"
        min="1"
        max="25"
        step="0.1"
      />

      <p class="instruction">
        Move the slider to change the number of dots per side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like the relationship between the vertices and edges in complete graphs, as you add dots per side, the triangular number increases far faster than the increase in dots per side.

        Both operations can be rephrased as
        <strong>f(n) = n * (n + 1)/2</strong> It's a convenient function! It can
        let you quickly count the edges in much larger complete graphs and get
        the triangular number for far bigger numbers.

        We are going to show that the number of edges in a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph"
          >complete graph</a
        >
        is equal to the sum of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number"
          >triangular series</a
        >
        that goes up to one less than the number for vertices in the complete
        graph.
