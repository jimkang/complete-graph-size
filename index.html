      <p>Now, let's talk about what a "triangular number" is.</p>
      <p>
        If you have <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span> dots per

        number is <span class="triangular-number-result-label">6</span> &mdash;

        Current dots per side: <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the relationship between the vertices and edges in complete graphs,
        adding one dot to a side usually adds <em>more</em> than one dot to the
        total number of dots in the triangle. Use the slider above to compare
        total number of dots for 2 dots per side and for 3 dots per side.
