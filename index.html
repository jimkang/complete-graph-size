        In graph theory, there is a concept called the

        what we can do with one, let's look at what a complete graph is.

      <p class="key-point important-term">
        A complete graph is a graph in which every vertex is connected to
        ever other vertex in the graph by an edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that, most of the time, there's more edges (lines) than vertices
        (dots). For example:
      </p>

      <section id="adjustable-graph">

          width="500"
          height="500"
          viewBox="0 0 100 100"
        >
          <g class="graph-edge-root"></g>
          <g class="graph-vertex-root"></g>

        <input
          class="graph-vertices-control"
          type="range"
          value="3"
          min="1"
          max="25"
          step="0.1"
        />
        <p class="instruction">
          Move the slider so that there are 2 vertices. Count the edges. Then,
          move the slider so that there are 3 vertices. Count the edges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Going from 2 to 3 vertices increases the number of vertices in the
          graph by <strong>1</strong>, but increases the number of edges by
          <strong>2</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you add a vertex (a dot), the number of edges (lines) also
          increases. But (except when going from 0 vertices to 1 or from one
          vertex to two)
          <em
            >the increase in edges is always greater than the increase in
            vertices.</em

          Here is a table with the edge counts for complete graphs with given
          numbers of vertices.

      <p>Now, let's talk about what a "triangular number" is.</p>
      <p>
        If you have <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span> dots per
        side in an equilateral triangle like the one below, the triangular
        number is <span class="triangular-number-result-label">6</span> &mdash;
        the total number of dots in the triangle.

      <p class="instruction">
        Move the slider to change the number of dots per side.<br />
        Current dots per side: <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the relationship between the vertices and edges in complete graphs,
        adding one dot to a side usually adds <em>more</em> than one dot to the
        total number of dots in the triangle. Use the slider above to compare
        total number of dots for 2 dots per side and for 3 dots per side.
