        We're going to look at a couple of cool concepts:
        <span class="important-term">complete graphs</span> and
        <span class="important-term">triangular numbers</span>. We are also
        going to look at a relationship that they share.

        Here is a <span class="important-term">complete graph</span>! It's a graph in which every single
        vertex is connected to ever other point in the graph by an edge.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a complete graph for
        <span class="vertex-count-label">3</span> vertices:

        Note that, most of the time, there's more edges (lines) than vertices
        (edges). More on that later!

      <p>Now, let's talk about what a "triangular number" is.</p>
      <p>
        If you have <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span> dots per
        side in an equilateral triangle like the one below, the triangular
        number is <span class="triangular-number-result-label">6</span> &mdash;
        the total number of dots in the triangle.

      <p class="instruction">
        Move the slider to change the number of dots per side.<br />
        Current dots per side: <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the relationship between the vertices and edges in complete graphs,
        adding one dot to a side usually adds <em>more</em> than one dot to the
        total number of dots in the triangle. Use the slider above to compare total number of dots for 2 dots per side and for 3 dots per side.

        Let's look more closely at the relationship between the vertices and edges in a
        complete graph now. Here is a complete graph for
        <span class="vertex-count-label">3</span> vertices again:

      <p class="instruction">
        Move the slider so that there are 2 vertices. Count
        the edges. Then, move the slider so that there are 3 vertices. Count the
        edges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going from 2 to 3 vertices increased the number of vertices by 1, but increased the
        number of edges by <em>2</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you add a vertex (a dot), the number of edges (lines) also
        increases. But &mdash; except when going from 0 vertices to 1 or from
        one vertex to two &mdash; <em>the increase in edges is always greater than
        the increase in vertices.</em>

        Both operations can be rephrased as
        <strong>f(n) = n * (n + 1)/2</strong> It's a convenient function! It can
        let you quickly count the edges in much larger complete graphs and get
        the triangular number for far bigger numbers.

        that goes up to one less than the number for vertices in the complete
