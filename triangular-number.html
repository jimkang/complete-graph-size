        Both operations can be rephrased as
        <strong>f(n) = n * (n + 1)/2</strong> It's a convenient function! It can
        let you quickly count the edges in much larger complete graphs and get
        the triangular number for far bigger numbers.

        How do we know?
        We are going to show that the number of edges in a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph"
          >complete graph</a
        >
        is equal to the sum of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number"
          >triangular series</a
        >
        that goes up to one less than the number for vertices in the complete
        graph.

    <section class="step" id="triangular-number-step">
      <p>Now, let's talk about what a "triangular number" is.</p>
      <p>
        If you have <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span> dots per
        side in an equilateral triangle like the one below, the triangular
        number is <span class="triangular-number-result-label">6</span> &mdash;
        the total number of dots in the triangle.
      </p>
      <svg
        id="triangular-number-board"
        width="600"
        height="500"
        viewBox="0 0 120 100"
      >
        <g id="triangle-row-root"></g>
        <g id="triangle-dot-root"></g>
      </svg>

      <input
        id="triangle-side-length-control"
        type="range"
        value="3"
        min="1"
        max="25"
        step="0.1"
      />

      <p class="instruction">
        Move the slider to change the number of dots per side.<br />
        Current dots per side: <span class="triangle-side-count-label">3</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the relationship between the vertices and edges in complete graphs,
        adding one dot to a side usually adds <em>more</em> than one dot to the
        total number of dots in the triangle. Use the slider above to compare
        total number of dots for 2 dots per side and for 3 dots per side.
